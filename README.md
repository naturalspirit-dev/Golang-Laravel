## About Goal Framework

Goal Framework is a common application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Goal Framework takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple and powerful middleware](https://github.com/goal-web/pipeline).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://github.com/goal-web/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://github.com/goal-web/session) and [cache](https://github.com/goal-web/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database](https://github.com/goal-web/database).
- [Robust background job processing](https://github.com/goal-web/queue).

Goal framework is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
